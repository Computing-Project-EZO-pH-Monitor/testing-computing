These are some important python modules we believe will be necessary for the project in the Raspberry Pi with i2c.

#!/usr/bin/env python

```{r}
import io # used to create file streams
import fcntl # used to access I2C parameters, like addresses
import time # used for sleep delay and timestamps
import string # helps parse strings
```
